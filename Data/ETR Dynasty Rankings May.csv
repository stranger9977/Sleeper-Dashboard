"66","1","Patrick Mahomes","KC","QB","26.7","QB01","QB01","Veteran","Best QB in football. Things will be different perhaps without Tyreek Hill, but Mahomes will still ball."
"67","2","Josh Allen","BUF","QB","26.0","QB02","QB02","Veteran","One of the most pass-happy offenses in the league, and Allen continues to hold terrific rushing upside."
"68","3","Lamar Jackson","BAL","QB","25.4","QB03","QB03","Veteran","Struggled with injuries in 2021, but still has an elite rushing floor and offensive structure."
"69","4","Kyler Murray","ARI","QB","24.8","QB04","QB04","Veteran","Arizona has done nothing but add weapons since it became clear Kyler was unhappy."
"1","5","Ja'Marr Chase","CIN","WR","22.2","WR01","WR01","Veteran","Already one of the best WRs in the league, and tied to his college QB for the immediate future."
"2","6","Justin Jefferson","MIN","WR","23.3","WR02","WR02","Veteran","Dominant through first two NFL seasons, and Minnesota should see a bump in pass rate with a new coach."
"89","7","Joe Burrow","CIN","QB","25.4","QB05","QB05","Veteran","Exciting young QB surrounded by exceptional weapons."
"90","8","Justin Herbert","LAC","QB","24.2","QB06","QB06","Veteran","Would like to see some better weaponry long-term, but LAC isn't afraid to throw with Herbert."
"3","9","A.J. Brown","PHI","WR","24.9","WR03","WR03","Veteran","Trade to Philly doesn't change much in the short term, but could be a major win long-term if their QB situation improves."
"4","10","CeeDee Lamb","DAL","WR","23.1","WR04","WR04","Veteran","Departure of Amari Cooper could unlock Lamb's ceiling in 2022."
"91","11","Deshaun Watson","CLE","QB","26.7","QB07","QB07","Veteran","Expecting a suspension somewhere in 2022, but an elite fantasy QB when on the field."
"92","12","Trey Lance","SF","QB","22.0","QB08","QB08","Veteran","Should start in 2022, was productive for fantasy despite poor passing in limited action."
"93","13","Dak Prescott","DAL","QB","28.8","QB09","QB09","Veteran","Lack of rushing in 2021 is a concern. Dak is far less enticing as a pure pocket passer."
"28","14","Kyle Pitts","ATL","TE","21.6","TE01","TE01","Veteran","Best rookie TE season in at least 60 years, don't worry about the lack of TDs."
"94","15","Russell Wilson","DEN","QB","33.5","QB10","QB10","Veteran","Unclear exactly what kind of offense we will get in Denver, but Russ should get his best chance to cook."
"5","16","Tee Higgins","CIN","WR","23.3","WR05","WR05","Veteran","More of a 1B to Chase than a 2. This is the best young offense in the NFL for dynasty."
"126","17","Trevor Lawrence","JAC","QB","22.6","QB11","QB11","Veteran","Chalking up a lot of his 2021 failures to the dysfunction surounding Urban Meyer."
"6","18","DK Metcalf","SEA","WR","24.4","WR06","WR06","Veteran","Showed us in his 2021 games with Geno Smith that he can produce with any QB. Buy the talent."
"7","19","DJ Moore","CAR","WR","25.1","WR07","WR07","Veteran","Over 1,200 scrimmage yards each of the past three seasons despite horrendous QB play. Still just 25."
"8","20","Jonathan Taylor","IND","RB","23.3","RB01","RB01","Veteran","The Colts' identity on offense is founded in running the football, and Taylor is still in his prime."
"9","21","Jaylen Waddle","MIA","WR","23.5","WR08","WR08","Veteran","Over 100 catches as a rookie. Still expected to thrive despite added target competition from Tyreek Hill."
"10","22","Deebo Samuel","SF","WR","26.3","WR09","WR09","Veteran","Somewhat unclear future and role, but Samuel is talented enough to be an elite WR no matter what."
"11","23","Drake London","ATL","WR","20.8","WR10","WR10","Rookie","Three year prospect with a breakout. Atlanta's offense should run directly through London and Kyle Pitts."
"12","24","Treylon Burks","TEN","WR","22.2","WR11","WR11","Rookie","Most frequently comped to AJ Brown in the predraft process. Now he gets to replace him in Tennessee."
"37","25","Mark Andrews","BAL","TE","26.7","TE02","TE02","Veteran","Target volume should be more consistent with Hollywood gone -- turns 27 this season."
"13","26","Cooper Kupp","LAR","WR","28.9","WR12","WR12","Veteran","Had one of the best WR seasons ever in 2021, but will be 29 by the time pre-season starts."
"14","27","Davante Adams","LV","WR","29.4","WR13","WR13","Veteran","Should continue to get fed while playing with his old college QB. Turns 30 late this season."
"15","28","Stefon Diggs","BUF","WR","28.5","WR14","WR14","Veteran","Took a step back in 2021, but tied to one of the best young QBs and pass-friendly offenses for at least three more seasons."
"16","29","Tyreek Hill","KC","WR","28.2","WR15","WR15","Veteran","Target volume and efficiency likely taking a big hit with the move to Miami. May not age well as a speed guy."
"127","30","Zach Wilson","NYJ","QB","22.8","QB12","QB12","Veteran","Jets are now loaded with weapons, and Wilson was running more late in his rookie year."
"128","31","Justin Fields","CHI","QB","23.2","QB13","QB13","Veteran","A new offensive system could be beneficial for Fields, but the weapons are terrible right now in Chicago."
"17","32","Najee Harris","PIT","RB","24.2","RB02","RB02","Veteran","Elite RB volume in his rookie year, and offense could improve with new QB under center."
"18","33","D'Andre Swift","DET","RB","23.3","RB03","RB03","Veteran","62 catches in 13 games in 2021. Needs to stay healthy, but Lion offense could be sneaky-good for the next few seasons."
"19","34","Javonte Williams","DEN","RB","22.1","RB04","RB04","Veteran","MGIII return is a bummer, but Williams should still be the lead back with elite upside."
"20","35","Breece Hall","NYJ","RB","21.0","RB05","RB05","Rookie","Day 1 starter in a high-upside Jet offense."
"129","36","Jalen Hurts","PHI","QB","23.8","QB14","QB14","Veteran","Elite fantasy producer with improved weapons, but Eagles still set up to move on from him after 2022."
"159","37","Tua Tagovailoa","MIA","QB","24.2","QB15","QB15","Veteran","Elite supporting cast, meaning Tua is likely out if he doesn't produce in 2022."
"21","38","Rashod Bateman","BAL","WR","22.5","WR16","WR16","Veteran","Sees a massive bump with the departure of Hollywood. Terrific prospect profile with decent rookie production."
"22","39","Jerry Jeudy","DEN","WR","23.1","WR17","WR17","Veteran","Should explode in 2022 with Russ in tow, still just 23 years old."
"23","40","DeVonta Smith","PHI","WR","23.5","WR18","WR18","Veteran","Brown will be the featured target, and the Eagles don't pass a ton. But the long-term potential is still here."
"24","41","Garrett Wilson","NYJ","WR","21.8","WR19","WR19","Rookie","Perfect RAC fit for the Jet offense. Top-10 pick with quality profile."
"25","42","Marquise Brown","ARI","WR","25.0","WR20","WR20","Veteran","Shower narrative alive and well in Arizona. Hollywood could out-target Hopkins under Kyler Murray."
"26","43","Elijah Moore","NYJ","WR","22.1","WR21","WR21","Veteran","Unclear who will be the top target for the Jets, but this offense could jam if Wilson is any good. "
"160","44","Matthew Stafford","LAR","QB","34.3","QB16","QB16","Veteran","Could stil play another 5+ years and the Rams will be an elite offense in the short-term."
"161","45","Derek Carr","LV","QB","31.2","QB17","QB17","Veteran","Extension cures a lot of concerns about longevity, and adding Adams is a huge boost to his weekly ceiling."
"162","46","Kirk Cousins","MIN","QB","33.8","QB18","QB18","Veteran","Expecting some more passing with a new coaching staff, and Cousins is tied up with Minny through 2023."
"27","47","Christian McCaffrey","CAR","RB","26.0","RB06","RB06","Veteran","Injuries have piled up quickly the last two seasons, but expected workload is still one of the highest in football."
"163","48","Mac Jones","NE","QB","23.7","QB19","QB19","Veteran","We need to see more passing in New England, but Jones looks the part of a long-term starter."
"164","49","Aaron Rodgers","GB","QB","38.5","QB20","QB20","Veteran","Back-to-back MVP with the worst weapons of his entire career. Will need some rookies to step up quickly."
"53","50","T.J. Hockenson","DET","TE","24.9","TE03","TE03","Veteran","Hasn't fully delivered on his prospect profile, but looked the part prior to injury in 2021."
"54","51","George Kittle","SF","TE","28.6","TE04","TE04","Veteran","A Deebo trade would help a ton with consistency. Perhaps the best two-way TE in the league right now."
"29","52","Austin Ekeler","LAC","RB","27.0","RB07","RB07","Veteran","Addition of Spiller may take away some rushing work, but Ekeler should still get most of the money touches."
"30","53","Dalvin Cook","MIN","RB","26.8","RB08","RB08","Veteran","Recurring injuries have been an issue, but the production has been great."
"31","54","Terry McLaurin","WFT","WR","26.7","WR22","WR22","Veteran","27 in September with an extension looming. Potential to be traded at some point if a deal is not reached."
"32","55","Chris Godwin","TB","WR","26.2","WR23","WR23","Veteran","ACL tear may slow early 2022 returns, but Godwin is locked up with Tampa and Tom Brady could play longer than expected."
"33","56","Amon-Ra St. Brown","DET","WR","22.6","WR24","WR24","Veteran","Three year prospect with a breakout who had 90/912/5 as a rookie."
"34","57","Joe Mixon","CIN","RB","25.8","RB09","RB09","Veteran","Clear workhorse for Cincy's elite offense."
"35","58","Nick Chubb","CLE","RB","26.4","RB10","RB10","Veteran","Would like to see more receiving production, but the rushing stats are elite."
"36","59","Alvin Kamara","NO","RB","26.8","RB11","RB11","Veteran","Could face a suspension in 2022 and second-contract RBs do not have a great shelf life."
"38","60","Chris Olave","NO","WR","21.9","WR25","WR25","Rookie","Four-year prospect, but the production and draft capital have us optimistic on future."
"39","61","Diontae Johnson","PIT","WR","25.9","WR26","WR26","Veteran","Entering a contract year, but should see better QB play without Big Ben."
"40","62","Michael Pittman Jr.","IND","WR","24.6","WR27","WR27","Veteran","Broke out in his second season -- Matt Ryan likely adds some stability to the passing game."
"41","63","Kadarius Toney","NYG","WR","23.3","WR28","WR28","Veteran","Flashed big-time talent as a rookie, but may not be long for New York. Some uncertainty on reliability."
"42","64","Derrick Henry","TEN","RB","28.4","RB12","RB12","Veteran","Should resume workhorse role in 2022, but showed he was human in 2021."
"59","65","Travis Kelce","KC","TE","32.6","TE05","TE05","Veteran","Still one of the best in the league, but will be 33 in October."
"60","66","Darren Waller","LV","TE","29.7","TE06","TE06","Veteran","Turns 30 in September and will see his toughest target competition as a Raider."
"43","67","Jameson Williams","DET","WR","21.1","WR29","WR29","Rookie","Unsure his profile will be as valuable for fantasy as real-life, and is unlikely to produce early off injury and with Detroit."
"44","68","Saquon Barkley","NYG","RB","25.3","RB13","RB13","Veteran","The writing is on the wall that Barkley could be nearing his end, but revamped Giants offense gives best chance at revival."
"165","69","Kenny Pickett","PIT","QB","24.0","QB21","QB21","Rookie","Older prospect with minimal rushing production, but goes to the most stable organization in sports with quality weaponry."
"45","70","Brandon Aiyuk","SF","WR","24.2","WR30","WR30","Veteran","Bounced back from the doghouse in 2021 to showcase the talent flashed in 2020. Some target volume concerns."
"46","71","Kenneth Walker III","SEA","RB","21.6","RB14","RB14","Rookie","Expect Seattle to #EstablishIt, but there likely won't be much receiving work in Walker's future."
"47","72","David Bell","CLE","WR","21.4","WR31","WR31","Rookie","Elite collegiate producer selected in the third round. Should be a 1-for-1 Jarvis Landry replacement with elite QB play."
"48","73","Gabriel Davis","BUF","WR","23.1","WR32","WR32","Veteran","Massive 200 yard, four TD game in the playoffs followed up with minimal addition at the WR position."
"49","74","George Pickens","PIT","WR","21.2","WR33","WR33","Rookie","True freshman breakout who struggled with injuries his final two seasons at Georgia. Great landing spot and upside."
"166","75","Tom Brady","TB","QB","44.8","QB22","QB22","Veteran","Producing at the top of the league at his position. Retirement an imminent threat, but could play multiple seasons."
"205","76","Davis Mills","HOU","QB","23.6","QB23","QB23","Veteran","Was perhaps the best rookie QB in 2021. Texans giving him a long look in 2022 prior to excellent 2023 QB draft."
"50","77","Mike Evans","TB","WR","28.7","WR34","WR34","Veteran","1,000 yards every season, but finally starting to age. 29 years old prior to the start of the season."
"51","78","Amari Cooper","CLE","WR","27.9","WR35","WR35","Veteran","Expected top target for Deshaun Watson. 28 before the season starts."
"52","79","Mike Williams","LAC","WR","27.6","WR36","WR36","Veteran","Sticks in LA with an extension that ties him to Justin Herbert. High long-term ceiling as Keenan Allen ages."
"55","80","Skyy Moore","KC","WR","21.7","WR37","WR37","Rookie","Hits the nut landing spot in KC after an impressive college career, albeit at a smaller school."
"56","81","Jahan Dotson","WFT","WR","22.2","WR38","WR38","Rookie","Prospect profile not encouraging, but draft capital is. Landing spot likely not as bad as one would initially think."
"57","82","Courtland Sutton","DEN","WR","26.6","WR39","WR39","Veteran","Needs to stay on the field, but already extended and now tied to Russell Wilson."
"58","83","JuJu Smith-Schuster","KC","WR","25.5","WR40","WR40","Veteran","Career revival in play with Mahomes. Doesn' turn 26 until November."
"61","84","Cam Akers","LAR","RB","22.9","RB15","RB15","Veteran","Not going to penalize Akers for games he wasn't expected to play in late in 2021. Hopefully a workhorse in 2022."
"62","85","Aaron Jones","GB","RB","27.5","RB16","RB16","Veteran","Don't love the direction of GB's offense, and AJ Dillon is a major threat, but Jones still has an elite target ceiling."
"63","86","J.K. Dobbins","BAL","RB","23.4","RB17","RB17","Veteran","Lead back for the best rushing attack in football, but likely in a committee and loses production to Lamar."
"64","87","Travis Etienne","JAC","RB","23.3","RB18","RB18","Veteran","Lisfranc injuries are scary enough to exercise caution on Etienne heading into Year 2."
"65","88","James Cook","BUF","RB","22.6","RB19","RB19","Rookie","Excellent receiver and a perfect fit for the Bills passing attack. Needs to score on the ground to reach his ceiling."
"70","89","Keenan Allen","LAC","WR","30.1","WR41","WR41","Veteran","30 years old, but continues to ball in PPR. Wondering if/when Mike Williams takes over as the top target."
"80","90","Noah Fant","SEA","TE","24.5","TE07","TE07","Veteran","Tough to ding Fant for QB play when it was already poor in Denver. Still buying the talent."
"81","91","Pat Freiermuth","PIT","TE","23.6","TE08","TE08","Veteran","Caught 60 passes as a rookie. Now sees improved QB play through the draft."
"206","92","Ryan Tannehill","TEN","QB","33.8","QB24","QB24","Veteran","Titans drafted a possible successor and could cut Tanny after 2022. However Willis' rawness likely buys him some time."
"207","93","Matt Ryan","IND","QB","37.0","QB25","QB25","Veteran","Should start for at least the next two seasons indoors in Indy. Low ceiling but high floor option."
"71","94","Chase Claypool","PIT","WR","23.9","WR42","WR42","Veteran","Steelers drafting two WRs is not promising for Claypool leaving the doghouse in 2022, but really flashed strongly as a rookie."
"72","95","DeAndre Hopkins","ARI","WR","30.0","WR43","WR43","Veteran","30 before the start of the season, and Kliff seems intent on spreading out the targets in Arizona."
"73","96","Brandin Cooks","HOU","WR","28.7","WR44","WR44","Veteran","29 in September, but has been a career producer wherever he has been."
"74","97","Elijah Mitchell","SF","RB","24.0","RB20","RB20","Veteran","Clear Shanahan fave in 2021, but Day 2 selection of a RB was jarring when considering the future."
"75","98","Antonio Gibson","WFT","RB","23.9","RB21","RB21","Veteran","Washington retained McKissic and added a Day 2 rookie, further muddying GIbson's outlook."
"76","99","A.J. Dillon","GB","RB","24.0","RB22","RB22","Veteran","Expecting Dillon to do more work on the ground this year, and should be featured in scoring areas."
"77","100","Allen Robinson II","LAR","WR","28.7","WR45","WR45","Veteran","Disappointing finish with the Bears. Received a big contract and boost in environment with the Rams."
"78","101","Darnell Mooney","CHI","WR","24.6","WR46","WR46","Veteran","Looking like the clear top weapon for Fields in 2022 after minimal additions at receiver. Likely not true in long-term."
"79","102","Christian Watson","GB","WR","23.0","WR47","WR47","Rookie","Old and raw prospect, but Packers trading up for him should present immediate opportunity given their depth chart."
"98","103","Dalton Schultz","DAL","TE","25.9","TE09","TE09","Veteran","Impressive breakout season in 2021, and Cooper departure should stabilize his target volume."
"99","104","Cole Kmet","CHI","TE","23.2","TE10","TE10","Veteran","Should see a career-high in targets in 2022. Athlete who was a top-50 pick in 2020."
"100","105","Mike Gesicki","MIA","TE","26.6","TE11","TE11","Veteran","Exension keeps Gesicki as the third option in a potentially exciting offense. Target volume could ultimately be an issue."
"101","106","Albert Okwuegbunam","DEN","TE","24.1","TE12","TE12","Veteran","Excellent prospect and athlete who had to wait his time, but now should be a key part of an ascending offense."
"82","107","Christian Kirk","JAC","WR","25.5","WR48","WR48","Veteran","After signing a massive, positional re-setting deal, Kirk should be the top target for Trevor Lawrence for at least 2022."
"83","108","Michael Thomas","NO","WR","29.2","WR49","WR49","Veteran","We haven't seen much of Thomas the last two seasons. There is definitely a chance he isn't the same at this point."
"84","109","Calvin Ridley","ATL","WR","27.4","WR50","WR50","Veteran","2022 suspension for gambling is a massive blow to Ridley's value. Likely has played his last down for Atlanta."
"108","110","Dallas Goedert","PHI","TE","27.4","TE13","TE13","Veteran","Brown trade hurts Goedert most. Also will be 28 by the end of 2022."
"219","111","Desmond Ridder","ATL","QB","22.7","QB26","QB26","Rookie","Should see the opportunity to start some games in 2022. Pre-draft comps to the bridge QB in place."
"220","112","Malik Willis","TEN","QB","23.0","QB27","QB27","Rookie","Rushing ability would make Willis a QB1 immediately with playing time, but draft capital and landing spot likely keep him on the bench fo the time being."
"85","113","James Conner","ARI","RB","27.0","RB23","RB23","Veteran","Extension and departure of Edmonds gives Conner a massive weekly ceiling in 2022."
"86","114","Leonard Fournette","TB","RB","27.3","RB24","RB24","Veteran","Addition of White on Day 2 could cost Fournette receiving work, but he is likely still the favorite option around the goal-line."
"87","115","Rachaad White","TB","RB","23.4","RB25","RB25","Rookie","43 receptions in his final season at ASU. Potentially major receiving work for one of the league's best offenses."
"88","116","Ezekiel Elliott","DAL","RB","26.8","RB26","RB26","Veteran","Dallas appears committed to keeping Zeke as the lead despite clear decline the past two seasons."
"95","117","John Metchie","HOU","WR","21.8","WR51","WR51","Rookie","Three year prospect coming off of an ACL tear. Went early on Day 2 and should command slot targets immediately."
"96","118","Michael Gallup","DAL","WR","26.2","WR52","WR52","Veteran","2022 production could suffer after late-season ACL tear, but contract extension will keep him in Dallas through at least 2023."
"97","119","Hunter Renfrow","LV","WR","26.4","WR53","WR53","Veteran","Adams addition crushes target volume, but Renfrow was impressive enough in 2021 to keep an eye on."
"120","120","Dawson Knox","BUF","TE","25.5","TE14","TE14","Veteran","Lack of major additions should keep Knox in positon to score plenty of TDs for Buffalo."
"121","121","Irv Smith Jr.","MIN","TE","23.8","TE15","TE15","Veteran","Missed all of 2021. Returns in 2022 to a barren WR depth chart, meaning target volume could be there."
"122","122","Trey McBride","ARI","TE","22.5","TE16","TE16","Rookie","Over 1,000 yards in his final college season. Target totem pole is clogged currently in Arizona."
"102","123","Rondale Moore","ARI","WR","21.9","WR54","WR54","Veteran","Disappointing rookie year, and Hollywood addition will make it difficult to see a huge spike in volume."
"103","124","Wan'Dale Robinson","NYG","WR","21.4","WR55","WR55","Rookie","Similar prospect to Rondale Moore in terms of size concerns, but high draft capital and Giants overall plan is encouraging."
"221","125","Matt Corral","CAR","QB","23.3","QB28","QB28","Rookie","Sam Darnold poses minimal competition despite poor draft capital. Corral is also a rushing threat."
"104","126","Dameon Pierce","HOU","RB","22.2","RB27","RB27","Rookie","Should be the immediate starter in Houston for a Texan offense potentially on the rise."
"105","127","Brian Robinson Jr.","WFT","RB","23.2","RB28","RB28","Rookie","Big back who excels in pass pro. Would it be terribly shocking if he overtook Antonio Gibson?"
"106","128","Josh Jacobs","LV","RB","24.3","RB29","RB29","Veteran","Vegas not picking up Jacobs' fifth year is concerning for his long-term viability, but should still be featured in 2022."
"107","129","David Montgomery","CHI","RB","25.0","RB30","RB30","Veteran","Unsure of what to make of Montgomery under a new regime, especially in a potentially poor Bears offense."
"135","130","Hunter Henry","NE","TE","27.5","TE17","TE17","Veteran","Big redzone target for Mac Jones, but need to see New England pass more to reach ceiling."
"136","131","David Njoku","CLE","TE","25.9","TE18","TE18","Veteran","An extension would boost the long-term viability here, but competition for targets has waned tremendously."
"137","132","Jelani Woods","IND","TE","23.6","TE19","TE19","Rookie","Athletic freak with minimal competition at the position."
"222","133","Daniel Jones","NYG","QB","25.0","QB29","QB29","Veteran","Giants seem intent on giving Jones a long look in 2022, but his career could effectively end soon after with a poor year."
"141","134","Evan Engram","JAC","TE","27.7","TE20","TE20","Veteran","One year prove-it deal with Jacksonville should result in decent target volume."
"109","135","Joshua Palmer","LAC","WR","22.7","WR56","WR56","Veteran","Showed he is capable of filling in for either Keenan Allen or Mike Williams as a rookie."
"142","136","Tyler Higbee","LAR","TE","29.4","TE21","TE21","Veteran","Turns 30 in January. Likely has quality TD upside in this offense, but unclear total target volume."
"143","137","Greg Dulcich","DEN","TE","22.1","TE22","TE22","Rookie","Highly efficient TE prospect, who may find himself in the same position Albert O was in the last couple of years."
"144","138","Jeremy Ruckert","NYJ","TE","21.8","TE23","TE23","Rookie","Under-utilized as a receiver at Ohio State, but blocking ability could get him on the field fairly quickly."
"110","139","Jalen Tolbert","DAL","WR","23.2","WR57","WR57","Rookie","Four-year prospect who broke out in Year 2. Dallas presents opportunity to earn a WR3 role with more in the future."
"111","140","Romeo Doubs","GB","WR","22.1","WR58","WR58","Rookie","Four-year prospect with an earlier career breakout. Provides some arbitrage on his rookie teammate Watson."
"112","141","Miles Sanders","PHI","RB","25.1","RB31","RB31","Veteran","Receiving workload has regressed tremendously, and Hurts steals rushing production."
"113","142","Devin Singletary","BUF","RB","24.7","RB32","RB32","Veteran","Bills telegraphed a desire to add competition for Singletary all off-season, and Cook will take the bulk of receiving work at minimum."
"114","143","Tony Pollard","DAL","RB","25.1","RB33","RB33","Veteran","More talented than Zeke at this point, but Dallas is intent on trotting him out there. 2023 free agent."
"115","144","Kareem Hunt","CLE","RB","26.8","RB34","RB34","Veteran","Stuck in Cleveland for one more year in a high-upside tandem role."
"116","145","Nico Collins","HOU","WR","23.2","WR59","WR59","Veteran","Metchie addition doesn't threaten Collins' role on the outside too much, and he flashed in 2021."
"117","146","Laviska Shenault Jr.","JAC","WR","23.6","WR60","WR60","Veteran","Jackonville may just be done with him."

"119","148","Tyler Lockett","SEA","WR","29.6","WR62","WR62","Veteran","Lack of a viable QB hurts Lockett the most given that he is already in the waning phases of his career."
"248","149","Jared Goff","DET","QB","27.6","QB30","QB30","Veteran","Lions added no competition here for 2022, but are still favorites to add a QB next draft. Fun array of weapons to see if he can still play."
"249","150","Baker Mayfield","CLE","QB","27.1","QB31","QB31","Veteran","Trade market has been oddly quiet, making it possible 2022 is simply a lost year."
"250","151","Jameis Winston","NO","QB","28.4","QB32","QB32","Veteran","Two-year contract buys Winston some time as the Saints press their final win-now window."
"251","152","Carson Wentz","WFT","QB","29.4","QB33","QB33","Veteran","Surprising that he keeps getting job opportunties -- this could be his last chance."
"123","153","Clyde Edwards-Helaire","KC","RB","23.1","RB35","RB35","Veteran","Ronald Jones presents a real rushing threat, which could transition CEH to more of a receiving specialist."
"124","154","Chase Edmonds","MIA","RB","26.1","RB36","RB36","Veteran","Favorite for the first carry in Miami, but Shanahan disciples make it difficult to trust with Mostert in town."
"125","155","Ronald Jones II","TB","RB","24.8","RB37","RB37","Veteran","Could lead the team in rushing yards and TDs in 2022. Not terribly viable long-term."
"130","156","Tyquan Thornton","NE","WR","21.8","WR63","WR63","Rookie","Surprise top-50 pick, but has sub-4.3 speed and a weak WR depth chart in New England."
"131","157","Alec Pierce","IND","WR","22.0","WR64","WR64","Rookie","Ex-volleyball athlete should compete to be the WR2 immediately. Similar profile to Nico Collins."
"132","158","Adam Thielen","MIN","WR","31.7","WR65","WR65","Veteran","Definitely in decline due to age, but the Vikings haven't added any competition just yet."
"133","159","Kenny Golladay","NYG","WR","28.5","WR66","WR66","Veteran","Injured in 2021 and looked terrible when on the field. Could be just the Giants general dysfunction in 2021."
"134","160","Allen Lazard","GB","WR","26.4","WR67","WR67","Veteran","Favorite to be the WR1 when the season opens, but could be passed by superior talents by year-end."

"140","166","James Robinson","JAC","RB","23.8","RB40","RB40","Veteran","Has excelled as a UDFA RB. If Etienne struggles off the injury, Robinson would be the biggest winner."
"145","167","K.J. Hamler","DEN","WR","22.9","WR68","WR68","Veteran","Hasn't popped yet, but his skillset fits better with Russell Wilson than any other DEN WR."

"158","183","Isaiah Spiller","LAC","RB","20.8","RB46","RB46","Rookie","Chargers have been vocal about wanting to take some of the burden off Ekeler. Spiller was a scout favorite who tested horribly."
"167","184","DeVante Parker","NE","WR","29.3","WR76","WR76","Veteran","Favorite to lead the WRs in targets, but likely not a long-term option. 29 years old with a deep injury history."
"168","185","Russell Gage","TB","WR","26.3","WR77","WR77","Veteran","May not see the exact same volume, but very live for the Antonio Brown role in 2022 and potentially beyond."

"202","192","Chigoziem Okonkwo","TEN","TE","22.7","TE29","TE29","Rookie","Ran a 4.52 in the 40 and then secured 4th round draft capital. Excellent draft and hold."
"178","193","Calvin Austin III","PIT","WR","23.2","WR84","WR84","Rookie","Blazed the 40 with a 4.32, but ultimately was a Day 3 WR selection."

"183","202","Tutu Atwell","LAR","WR","22.6","WR86","WR86","Veteran","Athletic producer who is probably too undersized for a major role with LA."
"184","203","Van Jefferson","LAR","WR","25.8","WR87","WR87","Veteran","Likely the fourth target in the offense at best in 2022."
"185","204","Jarvis Landry","FA","WR","29.5","WR88","WR88","Veteran","Landing spot will dictate much of what we can get out of Landry in the future."
"186","205","Julio Jones","FA","WR","33.3","WR89","WR89","Veteran","The Titans took a huge cap hit to get Jones off their roster -- not a good sign for what he has left in the tank."
"217","206","Adam Trautman","NO","TE","25.3","TE32","TE32","Veteran","Should ascend to be the featured TE in 2022, but the Saints have not been a high-volume pass game recently."

"190","210","Cordarrelle Patterson","ATL","RB","31.2","RB51","RB51","Veteran","Awesome dual threat early in 2021 before being set to a pure RB role. Should catch some more passes this year, but already 31."

"209","229","Velus Jones Jr.","CHI","WR","25.0","WR98","WR98","Rookie","Already 25 years old as a rookie. Should be more of a special teamer than WR."
"210","230","James Washington","DAL","WR","26.1","WR99","WR99","Veteran","Should open 2022 as the WR2 if Gallup isn't ready, but could drop to WR4 upon his return and Tolber improvement."
"211","231","Khalil Herbert","CHI","RB","24.1","RB56","RB56","Veteran","Looked good with 2021 chances -- definitely not a lock that Montgomery is far ahead in touches."
"212","232","Alexander Mattison","MIN","RB","23.9","RB57","RB57","Veteran","Will resume is typical handcuff workhorse position in 2022."
"213","233","Samaje Perine","CIN","RB","26.7","RB58","RB58","Veteran","Clear backup to Mixon."
